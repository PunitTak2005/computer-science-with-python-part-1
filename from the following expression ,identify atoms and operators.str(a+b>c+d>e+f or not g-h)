To identify the atoms and operators in the expression `str(a+b>c+d>e+f or not g-h)`, let's break it down into its components.

### Expression Breakdown

The expression is:
```python
str(a+b>c+d>e+f or not g-h)
```

### Atoms

Atoms are the basic building blocks of expressions. In this case, the atoms are:

1. **Variables and Constants**:
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h` (These are identifiers that refer to values)

2. **Function Calls**:
   - `str(...)` (This is a function call to `str`, which converts the result of the inner expression to a string)

### Operators

Operators are symbols that perform operations on operands. In this expression, the operators are:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**:
   - `+` (Addition)
   - `-` (Subtraction)

2. **Comparison Operators**:
   - `>` (Greater than)

3. **Logical Operators**:
   - `or` (Logical OR)
   - `not` (Logical NOT)

### Expression Analysis

- **Function Call**: `str(...)` is a function call that converts the result of the inner expression to a string.
- **Inside `str(...)`**: `a+b>c+d>e+f or not g-h`

  - **Arithmetic Operations**:
    - `a + b` (Addition)
    - `c + d` (Addition)
    - `e + f` (Addition)
    - `g - h` (Subtraction)

  - **Comparison Operations**:
    - `a + b > c + d` (Comparison)
    - `c + d > e + f` (Comparison)

  - **Logical Operations**:
    - `a + b > c + d > e + f` (Chained Comparison)
    - `not (g - h)` (Logical NOT)
    - `(a + b > c + d > e + f) or (not (g - h))` (Logical OR)

### Summary

- **Atoms**: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, and the function `str`.
- **Operators**: `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `>` (greater than), `or` (logical OR), `not` (logical NOT).

The overall structure of the expression is a call to the `str` function with a logical expression that involves both arithmetic and comparison operations, combined with logical operators.
