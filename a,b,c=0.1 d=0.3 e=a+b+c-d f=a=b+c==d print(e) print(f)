There are a couple of issues with the code snippet you provided:

1. The assignment to `a, b, c` is incorrect. You need to provide three values to unpack into `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. The assignment `f=a=b+c==d` will not work as intended due to syntax issues.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
a, b, c = 0.1, 0.1, 0.1
d = 0.3
e = a + b + c - d
f = a == b + c == d

print(e)
print(f)
```

Let's break down what this code does:
- `a`, `b`, `c` are all set to `0.1`.
- `d` is set to `0.3`.
- `e` calculates the expression `a + b + c - d`.
- `f` checks if `a` is equal to the sum of `b + c` and if that sum is also equal to `d`.

Now let's run it:

```python
a, b, c = 0.1, 0.1, 0.1
d = 0.3
e = a + b + c - d
f = a == b + c == d

print(e)
print(f)
```

This should print the value of `e` and the boolean value of `f`.
