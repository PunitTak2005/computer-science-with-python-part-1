In Python, the distinction between `str` type strings and `unicode` type strings primarily depends on the version of Python you are using.

### Python 2

In Python 2, there are two types of strings:

1. **`str` type**: These are sequences of bytes. By default, string literals are of this type. For example:
   ```python
   my_str = 'hello'
   ```

2. **`unicode` type**: These are sequences of Unicode code points. To create a `unicode` string, you prefix the string with a `u`. For example:
   ```python
   my_unicode_str = u'hello'
   ```

### Python 3

In Python 3, the distinction is simplified:

1. **`str` type**: This is the default string type, and it represents Unicode strings. All string literals are Unicode by default. For example:
   ```python
   my_str = 'hello'
   ```

2. **`bytes` type**: If you need to work with raw bytes, you use the `bytes` type. A `bytes` object is created by prefixing the string with a `b`. For example:
   ```python
   my_bytes = b'hello'
   ```

### Summary of Differences

- **Python 2**:
  - `str`: A sequence of bytes.
  - `unicode`: A sequence of Unicode code points, created by prefixing with `u`.

- **Python 3**:
  - `str`: A sequence of Unicode code points (the default string type).
  - `bytes`: A sequence of bytes, created by prefixing with `b`.

### Practical Implications

- **Encoding and Decoding**: In both Python 2 and Python 3, you often need to encode and decode strings when converting between `str` and `unicode`/`bytes`. For example:
  - Python 2:
    ```python
    unicode_str = u'hello'
    byte_str = unicode_str.encode('utf-8')
    decoded_unicode_str = byte_str.decode('utf-8')
    ```

  - Python 3:
    ```python
    unicode_str = 'hello'
    byte_str = unicode_str.encode('utf-8')
    decoded_unicode_str = byte_str.decode('utf-8')
    ```

- **Compatibility**: When writing code that needs to be compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3, be mindful of these differences and use tools like `six` or `future` libraries to ease the transition.

Understanding these distinctions is crucial for handling text data correctly, especially when dealing with internationalization or working with data that includes non-ASCII characters.
