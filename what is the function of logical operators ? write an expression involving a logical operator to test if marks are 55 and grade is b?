**Logical operators** are used to perform logical operations on Boolean values (`True` or `False`). They allow you to combine multiple conditions and test whether all or some of them are true. The primary logical operators in Python are:

1. **`and`**: Returns `True` if both operands are true; otherwise, it returns `False`.
   - Example: `(x > 5) and (y < 10)` returns `True` if both conditions are true.

2. **`or`**: Returns `True` if at least one of the operands is true; otherwise, it returns `False`.
   - Example: `(x > 5) or (y < 10)` returns `True` if at least one condition is true.

3. **`not`**: Returns `True` if the operand is false; otherwise, it returns `False`.
   - Example: `not (x > 5)` returns `True` if `x` is not greater than 5.

### Example Expression

To test if `marks` are `55` and `grade` is `'b'`, you can use the `and` logical operator. Hereâ€™s how you can write this expression:

```python
marks = 55
grade = 'b'

# Using logical operator 'and' to test both conditions
result = (marks == 55) and (grade == 'b')

print(result)  # Output: True if both conditions are met
```

### Explanation

- **`marks == 55`**: This checks if the variable `marks` is equal to `55`.
- **`grade == 'b'`**: This checks if the variable `grade` is equal to `'b'`.
- **`and`**: Combines the two conditions. The `result` will be `True` if both conditions are true; otherwise, it will be `False`.

In this example:
- If `marks` is `55` and `grade` is `'b'`, the expression will evaluate to `True`.
- If either `marks` is not `55` or `grade` is not `'b'`, the expression will evaluate to `False`.
