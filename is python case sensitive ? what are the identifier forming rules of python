Yes, Python is case-sensitive. This means that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as distinct characters.

Here are the identifier forming rules in Python:

1. Identifiers can contain letters (a-z or A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_).
2. Identifiers must start with a letter or an underscore.
3. Identifiers cannot start with a digit.
4. Identifiers are case-sensitive (e.g., myvariable and MyVariable are different identifiers).
5. Identifiers cannot contain special characters or symbols (except for underscores).
6. Identifiers cannot be reserved keywords (e.g., if, else, for, etc.).
7. Identifiers cannot contain whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, etc.).

Here are some examples of valid identifiers in Python:

- my_variable
- HelloWorld
- _private_variable
- calculate_area
- student_name

And here are some examples of invalid identifiers:

- 123abc (starts with a digit)
- my variable (contains whitespace)
- hello-world (contains special character)
- if (reserved keyword)
- My Variable (contains whitespace)

By following these rules, you can create valid and unique identifiers in Python.
