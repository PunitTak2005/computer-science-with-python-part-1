A,B,C,D=9.2,2.0,4,21
print(A/4)
print(A//4)
print(B**C)
print(D//B)
print(A%C)


Here is the output of each operation along with an explanation:

```python
A, B, C, D = 9.2, 2.0, 4, 21

print(A / 4)    # 9.2 divided by 4
print(A // 4)   # 9.2 floor divided by 4
print(B ** C)   # 2.0 raised to the power of 4
print(D // B)   # 21 floor divided by 2.0
print(A % C)    # 9.2 modulo 4
```

Let's go through each line:

1. `print(A / 4)`
   - This performs floating-point division.
   - \( \frac{9.2}{4} = 2.3 \)
   - Output: `2.3`

2. `print(A // 4)`
   - This performs floor division. For floating-point numbers, it returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result.
   - \( \left\lfloor \frac{9.2}{4} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 2.3 \right\rfloor = 2.0 \)
   - Output: `2.0`

3. `print(B ** C)`
   - This raises \( B \) to the power of \( C \).
   - \( 2.0^4 = 16.0 \)
   - Output: `16.0`

4. `print(D // B)`
   - This performs floor division.
   - \( \left\lfloor \frac{21}{2.0} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 10.5 \right\rfloor = 10.0 \)
   - Output: `10.0`

5. `print(A % C)`
   - This calculates the remainder of \( A \) divided by \( C \).
   - \( 9.2 \mod 4 = 9.2 - 4 \times \left\lfloor \frac{9.2}{4} \right\rfloor = 9.2 - 4 \times 2 = 9.2 - 8 = 1.2 \)
   - Output: `1.2`

So, the printed outputs are:

```
2.3
2.0
16.0
10.0
1.2
```
