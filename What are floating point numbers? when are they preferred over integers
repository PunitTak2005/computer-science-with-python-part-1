**Floating-point numbers** are a data type used to represent real numbers that require a fractional component. They are expressed in scientific notation, which allows for a wide range of values, including very small and very large numbers. Floating-point numbers are useful for representing quantities that are not whole numbers and for performing arithmetic with fractional values.

### Characteristics of Floating-Point Numbers:

1. **Representation**:
   - Floating-point numbers are represented in the form of `m × 10^e`, where `m` is the mantissa (or significand) and `e` is the exponent. For example, `3.14` can be represented as `3.14 × 10^0`, and `0.0001` can be represented as `1.0 × 10^-4`.

2. **Precision**:
   - Floating-point numbers have limited precision due to the finite number of bits used to represent them. This can lead to rounding errors and precision loss in calculations.

3. **Range**:
   - They can represent a much wider range of values compared to integers, including very large and very small numbers.

### When to Prefer Floating-Point Numbers Over Integers:

1. **Fractional Values**:
   - Use floating-point numbers when you need to represent values with a fractional component. For example, measurements like weight, temperature, or currency often require floating-point precision.

2. **Arithmetic Operations**:
   - When performing calculations that require division or other operations resulting in non-integer results, floating-point numbers are appropriate. For instance, `7 / 3` results in `2.333...`, which is best represented as a floating-point number.

3. **Scientific and Engineering Calculations**:
   - Floating-point numbers are essential in scientific and engineering fields where precision and a wide range of values are required for calculations, such as in simulations, data analysis, and modeling.

4. **Real-World Measurements**:
   - In cases where measurements are not exact integers, such as heights, distances, or volumes, floating-point numbers are preferred.

### Example

```python
a = 7
b = 3
result_integer = a // b  # Integer division, result is 2
result_float = a / b    # Floating-point division, result is 2.333...

print(result_integer)  # Output: 2
print(result_float)    # Output: 2.3333333333333335
```

In summary, floating-point numbers are preferred over integers when dealing with real-world measurements, fractional values, and calculations that involve non-integer results. They provide the flexibility needed to handle a wide range of values and precision requirements, despite their limitations in exactness due to rounding errors.
