what are literals ? how many types of literals are available in python?
Literals are fixed values that are written directly in the code, without any computation or evaluation. They are used to represent constant values in a program.

In Python, there are several types of literals:

1. Integer literals: Positive or negative whole numbers, like 42 or -10.

2. Floating-point literals: Decimal numbers, like 3.14 or -0.5.

3. String literals: Sequences of characters enclosed in quotes (single or double), like 'hello' or "goodbye".

4. Boolean literals: The values True and False.

5. Complex literals: Numbers with both real and imaginary parts, like 3 + 4j.

6. Byte literals: Sequences of bytes, like b'hello'.

7. Bytearray literals: Mutable sequences of bytes, like bytearray(b'hello').

8. List literals: Ordered collections of values enclosed in square brackets, like [1, 2, 3].

9. Tuple literals: Ordered, immutable collections of values enclosed in parentheses, like (1, 2, 3).

10. Dict literals: Unordered collections of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces, like {'a': 1, 'b': 2}.

These literals are used to represent constant values in Python code, making it easier to write and understand programs.
