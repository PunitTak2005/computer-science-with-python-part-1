what is an expression and a statement

In Python, an expression and a statement are two related but distinct concepts:

Expression

An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that evaluates to a single value. Expressions are used to perform calculations, manipulate data, and make decisions.

Examples of expressions:

- 2 + 3 (evaluates to 5)
- x * 4 (evaluates to the value of x multiplied by 4)
- len("hello") (evaluates to 5, the length of the string "hello")
- True and False (evaluates to False)

Statement

A statement is a single line of code that performs an action, declares a variable, or controls the flow of a program. Statements are used to execute expressions, assign values, and control the program's flow.

Examples of statements:

- x = 5 (assigns the value 5 to the variable x)
- print("hello") (prints the string "hello" to the console)
- if x > 5: print("x is greater than 5") (conditional statement that prints a message if x is greater than 5)
- for i in range(5): print(i) (loop statement that prints numbers 0 through 4)

Key differences:

- Expressions evaluate to a value, while statements perform an action.
- Expressions can be used as part of a statement, but statements cannot be used as expressions.
- Expressions do not change the program's state, while statements can modify variables, print output, or control the flow of the program.

In summary, expressions are used to compute values, while statements are used to execute actions and control the program's flow.
