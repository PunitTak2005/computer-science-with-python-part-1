what is a block or suite in python ? How is indentation  related to it

In Python, a block or suite is a group of statements that are executed together. A block is defined by its indentation, which is the whitespace at the beginning of each line.

A block or suite can be:

- A function body
- A loop body (e.g., for, while)
- A conditional block (e.g., if, elif, else)
- A try-except block
- A class definition

Indentation is crucial in Python because it defines the block structure. Here's how it works:

- The first line of a block starts with no indentation (or a minimal amount, like 4 spaces).
- Each subsequent line in the block must have the same amount of indentation (usually 4 spaces).
- When the indentation returns to the initial level (or less), the block ends.

Python uses this indentation scheme to define block-level structure, unlike other languages that use curly braces, keywords, or other delimiters.

Here's an example:

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")  # This line is indented, so it's part of the if block
    y = 3  # This line is also indented, so it's part of the if block
print("This line is not indented, so it's outside the if block")

In this example, the two lines inside the if block have the same indentation (4 spaces), which defines the block. The last line has no indentation, so it's outside the block.

By using indentation to define blocks, Python code becomes more readable and easier to understand, as the structure is clearly visible.
