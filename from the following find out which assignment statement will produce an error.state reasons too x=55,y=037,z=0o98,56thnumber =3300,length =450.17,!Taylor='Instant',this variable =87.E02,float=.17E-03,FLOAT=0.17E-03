The assignment statement that will produce an error is:

this variable = 87.E02

Reason: In Python, variable names cannot contain spaces. The correct variable name would be this_variable or thisVariable.

Additionally, the following assignment statements may raise warnings or errors in certain contexts:

- y = 037: This will be interpreted as an octal number (31 in decimal), but leading zeros in decimal literals are not allowed in Python 3.x.
- z = 0o98: This is an invalid octal literal; octal numbers cannot contain the digit 8 or 9.

All other assignment statements appear to be valid:

- x = 55: Assigns an integer value to x.
- 56thnumber = 3300: Assigns an integer value to 56thnumber.
- length = 450.17: Assigns a floating-point value to length.
- !Taylor = 'Instant': Assigns a string value to !Taylor (note: the variable name starts with an exclamation mark, which is unconventional but allowed).
- float = .17E-03: Assigns a floating-point value to float (note: using float as a variable name may shadow the built-in float type).
- FLOAT = 0.17E-03: Assigns a floating-point value to FLOAT.
