write a program to read today's date (only del part) from user.Then display how many days are left in the current month

Here is a Python program that reads today's date (day part) from the user and displays how many days are left in the current month:


from datetime import datetime

# Get today's date from the user
day = int(input("Enter today's day: "))

# Get the current month and year
now = datetime.now()
month = now.month
year = now.year

# Get the total number of days in the current month
if month in [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]:
    total_days = 31
elif month == 2:
    if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or year % 400 == 0:
        total_days = 29
    else:
        total_days = 28
else:
    total_days = 30

# Calculate the number of days left in the month
days_left = total_days - day

# Display the result
print(f"There are {days_left} days left in the current month.")


Here's how it works:

1. The user is prompted to enter today's day.
2. The current month and year are obtained using the datetime module.
3. The total number of days in the current month is determined based on the month and year.
4. The number of days left in the month is calculated by subtracting the user-input day from the total number of days.
5. The result is displayed to the user.
