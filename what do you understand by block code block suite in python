In Python, a:

- Code Block: A group of statements that are executed together as a single unit. Code blocks are defined by their indentation (four spaces or a tab).
- Suite: A sequence of statements that are executed in order. A suite can be a single statement or a code block.

In other words, a suite is a collection of statements, and a code block is a specific type of suite that is defined by its indentation.

Here's an example:

if x > 5:
    # This is a code block (suite) with two statements
    print("x is greater than 5")
    y = x * 2

In this example:

- The if statement is a single statement.
- The indented code block (with two statements) is a suite.
- The entire if statement, including the code block, is a code block (suite).

Python uses indentation to define the structure of the code, so it's essential to use consistent indentation to define code blocks and suites correctly.

Here are some more examples of code blocks and suites:

- A single statement is a simple suite:

x = 5

- A loop is a code block (suite) with multiple statements:

for i in range(5):
    print(i)
    y = i * 2

- A function definition is a code block (suite) with multiple statements:

def my_function():
    x = 5
    y = x * 2
    return y
