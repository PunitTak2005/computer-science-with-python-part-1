Here's a simple Python code snippet to obtain a balance amount:


# Initialize the balance
balance = 0.0

# Function to deposit amount
def deposit(amount):
    global balance
    balance += amount
    print(f"Deposited: {amount}")
    print(f"Current Balance: {balance}")

# Function to withdraw amount
def withdraw(amount):
    global balance
    if amount > balance:
        print("Insufficient balance")
    else:
        balance -= amount
        print(f"Withdrawn: {amount}")
        print(f"Current Balance: {balance}")

# Function to check balance
def check_balance():
    print(f"Current Balance: {balance}")

# Main program
while True:
    print("\n1. Deposit")
    print("2. Withdraw")
    print("3. Check Balance")
    print("4. Exit")
    choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

    if choice == "1":
        amount = float(input("Enter amount to deposit: "))
        deposit(amount)
    elif choice == "2":
        amount = float(input("Enter amount to withdraw: "))
        withdraw(amount)
    elif choice == "3":
        check_balance()
    elif choice == "4":
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")


This code provides a simple menu-driven program to:

1. Deposit an amount
2. Withdraw an amount
3. Check the current balance
4. Exit the program

Note: This code uses a global variable balance to store the current balance. The deposit and withdraw functions modify this globalÂ variable.
