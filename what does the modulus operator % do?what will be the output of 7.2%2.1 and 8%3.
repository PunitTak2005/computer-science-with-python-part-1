The modulus operator % returns the remainder of the division of one number by another. It's used to find out what remains after division. Here's a more detailed look:

For integers, it gives the remainder of the division.
Example: 10 % 3 results in 1, because 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1.
For floating-point numbers, it also gives the remainder of the division but in floating-point form.
Example: 7.5 % 2.5 results in 0.0, because 7.5 divided by 2.5 is 3 with no remainder.
