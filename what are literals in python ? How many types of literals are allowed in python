In Python, literals are values that are written directly in the code, such as numbers, strings, booleans, and more. They are called "literals" because they are literal values, not variables or expressions.

Python has the following types of literals:

1. Integer literals: Whole numbers, like 123, 456, etc.
2. Floating-point literals: Decimal numbers, like 3.14, -0.5, etc.
3. String literals: Text enclosed in quotes, like "hello", 'hello', etc.
4. Boolean literals: True or False values, like True, False.
5. Complex literals: Numbers with real and imaginary parts, like 3+4j, 2-3j, etc.
6. Bytes literals: Sequence of integers in the range 0 <= x < 256, like b'hello', b'\x01\x02', etc.
7. Bytearray literals: Mutable sequence of integers in the range 0 <= x < 256, like bytearray(b'hello'), etc.
8. List literals: Ordered collections of values, like [1, 2, 3], ["a", "b", "c"], etc.
9. Tuple literals: Ordered, immutable collections of values, like (1, 2, 3), ("a", "b", "c"), etc.
10. Dictionary literals: Unordered collections of key-value pairs, like {"a": 1, "b": 2}, etc.
11. Set literals: Unordered collections of unique values, like {1, 2, 3}, etc.
12. Ellipsis literal: A single value, like ....

These literals can be used directly in your code to represent values, and they can be assigned to variables, passed as function arguments, and more.
