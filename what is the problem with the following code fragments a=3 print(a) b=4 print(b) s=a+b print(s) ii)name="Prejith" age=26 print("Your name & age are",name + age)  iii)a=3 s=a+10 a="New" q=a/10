what is the problem with the following code fragments
a=3
print(a)
b=4
print(b)
s=a+b
print(s)
ii)name="Prejith"
age=26
print("Your name & age are",name + age)

iii)a=3
s=a+10
a="New"
q=a/10

Here are the problems with each code fragment in Python:

i)

- No issues, this code will run correctly in Python.

ii)

- The + operator cannot be used to concatenate a string with an integer. You need to convert the integer to a string using str() or use string formatting.

Corrected version:


name = "Prejith"
age = 26
print("Your name & age are", name, age)


Or, using string formatting:


print(f"Your name & age are {name} {age}")


iii)

- Assigning a string value to a variable that previously held an integer value is allowed in Python, but it's generally discouraged.
- Trying to divide a string by an integer will raise a TypeError.

Corrected version:


a = 3
s = a + 10
print(s)
a = "New"  # This will work, but it's generally discouraged to reuse variables like this
q = "Cannot divide a string by an integer!"
print(q)


Or, if you want to perform division:


a = 3
s = a + 10
print(s)
a = 10  # Assign a new integer value
q = a / 10
print(q)
