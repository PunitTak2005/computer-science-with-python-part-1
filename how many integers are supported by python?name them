Python supports a virtually unlimited number of integers due to its support for arbitrary-precision integers. This means that, unlike many other programming languages that have fixed-width integer types (e.g., 32-bit or 64-bit integers), Python’s integer type (`int`) can grow as large as the available memory allows.

### Key Points about Python Integers:

1. **Arbitrary Precision**:
   - Python’s `int` type is not limited by fixed sizes and can handle very large numbers without overflow. This is because Python's `int` is implemented as a variable-length object.

2. **Python 2 vs. Python 3**:
   - In Python 2, there were two types of integers:
     - `int`: Typically a fixed-width integer (often 32-bit or 64-bit).
     - `long`: Arbitrary-precision integer.
   - In Python 3, the `int` type has been unified to handle arbitrary-precision integers, and the `long` type has been removed.

### Integer Types in Python 3

In Python 3, there is effectively only one integer type:

- **`int`**: This type represents integer values and can be of any size.

### Examples of Using `int` in Python 3

```python
# Small integer
a = 42

# Large integer
b = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890

# Even larger integer
c = 987654321987654321987654321987654321987654321987654321
```

### Summary

- **Number of Integers Supported**: Python supports an essentially unlimited number of integers due to its arbitrary-precision `int` type.
- **Integer Type**: In Python 3, the integer type is simply `int`, which encompasses all integer values, including both small and very large numbers.

This flexibility makes Python well-suited for applications requiring large numerical computations without concerns about integer overflow.
