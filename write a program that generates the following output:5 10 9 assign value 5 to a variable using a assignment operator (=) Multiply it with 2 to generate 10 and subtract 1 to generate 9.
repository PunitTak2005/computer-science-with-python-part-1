write a program that generates the following output:5
10
9
assign value 5 to a variable using a assignment operator (=) Multiply it with 2 to generate 10 and subtract 1 to generate 9.


Here is a Python program that generates the desired output:


# Assign value 5 to a variable
a = 5
print(a)  # Output: 5

# Multiply a by 2 to generate 10
a *= 2
print(a)  # Output: 10

# Subtract 1 to generate 9
a -= 1
print(a)  # Output: 9


This program uses the assignment operator = to assign the value 5 to the variable a. Then, it uses the multiplication assignment operator *= to multiply a by 2, resulting in 10. Finally, it uses the subtraction assignment operator -= to subtract 1 from a, resulting in 9.

Alternatively, you can also write the program in a single line using tuple unpacking:


a, b, c = 5, 5*2, 5*2-1
print(a, b, c)  # Output: 5 10 9
