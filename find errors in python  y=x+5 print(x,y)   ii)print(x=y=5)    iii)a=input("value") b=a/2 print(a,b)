Here are the errors in each Python code fragment:

i)

- The variable x is not defined before it's used in the expression y=x+5. This will raise a NameError.

Corrected version:


x = 5
y = x + 5
print(x, y)


ii)

- The syntax print(x=y=5) is incorrect. You can't assign a value to x and y inside the print() function like this. This will raise a SyntaxError.

Corrected version:


x = y = 5
print(x, y)


iii)

- The input() function returns a string, so a will be a string. Then, trying to divide a by an integer (2) will raise a TypeError.

Corrected version:


a = int(input("Value: "))  # Convert input to integer
b = a / 2
print(a, b)


Or, if you want to handle non-integer inputs:


a = input("Value: ")
try:
    a = int(a)
    b = a / 2
    print(a, b)
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter an integer.")
