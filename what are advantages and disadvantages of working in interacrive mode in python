Working in interactive mode in Python (also known as the REPL, or Read-Eval-Print Loop) has both advantages and disadvantages:

Advantages:

1. Immediate feedback: You can execute code and see the results immediately, without having to write a full program.
2. Exploration: Interactive mode is great for exploring libraries, testing functions, and understanding how things work.
3. Debugging: You can test and debug small code snippets quickly.
4. Learning: Interactive mode is an excellent way to learn Python, as you can try out new concepts and see the results in real-time.
5. Prototyping: You can quickly prototype ideas and test them without writing a full program.

Disadvantages:

1. Limited code organization: Your code can become disorganized and difficult to manage as you work in interactive mode.
2. No version control: You don't have a record of your changes or versions, making it difficult to track progress or revert to previous versions.
3. No debugging tools: While you can debug small issues, interactive mode lacks advanced debugging tools like breakpoints and tracebacks.
4. Performance: Interactive mode can be slower than running a script, as each command is executed individually.
5. Limited scalability: As your project grows, interactive mode becomes impractical for managing large codebases.

In summary, interactive mode is ideal for exploration, learning, and quick testing, but it's not suitable for large-scale development or complex projects. Once you've prototyped and tested your ideas, it's usually best to move to a script or a full-fledged project to organize and refine your code.
