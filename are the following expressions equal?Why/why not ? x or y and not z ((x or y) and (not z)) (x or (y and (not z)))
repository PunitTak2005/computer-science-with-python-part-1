Let's analyze and compare the three expressions to determine if they are equal. 

### Expressions to Compare

1. **Expression 1**: `x or y and not z`
2. **Expression 2**: `((x or y) and (not z))`
3. **Expression 3**: `(x or (y and (not z)))`

### Operator Precedence

To determine if these expressions are equal, we need to understand operator precedence:

1. **Logical NOT**: `not`
2. **Logical AND**: `and`
3. **Logical OR**: `or`

The precedence from highest to lowest is: `not`, `and`, `or`.

### Evaluate Each Expression

#### Expression 1: `x or y and not z`

Using operator precedence:
- `y and not z` is evaluated first.
  - **`not z`** is evaluated first, converting `z` to its Boolean opposite.
  - **`y and (not z)`** is evaluated next.
- Finally, `x or (y and not z)` is evaluated.

So, Expression 1 evaluates as:
```python
x or (y and (not z))
```

#### Expression 2: `((x or y) and (not z))`

Using parentheses, this expression is evaluated in the following order:
- **`x or y`** is evaluated first.
- **`not z`** is evaluated next.
- **`(x or y) and (not z)`** is evaluated last.

So, Expression 2 evaluates as:
```python
(x or y) and (not z)
```

#### Expression 3: `(x or (y and (not z)))`

Using parentheses, this expression is evaluated in the following order:
- **`y and (not z)`** is evaluated first.
- **`x or (y and (not z))`** is evaluated last.

So, Expression 3 evaluates as:
```python
x or (y and (not z))
```

### Comparison

**Expression 1** and **Expression 3** are equivalent:
- **Expression 1** evaluates as: `x or (y and not z)`
- **Expression 3** evaluates as: `x or (y and (not z))`

Both are structurally identical and follow the same precedence rules.

**Expression 2** is different:
- **Expression 2** evaluates as: `(x or y) and (not z)`

This expression evaluates `x or y` first, and then combines the result with `not z` using `and`. 

### Summary

- **Expression 1** and **Expression 3** are equal because they follow the same operator precedence rules and can be simplified to the same structure.
- **Expression 2** is not equal to the other two. It evaluates `x or y` first and then applies `and` with `not z`, which is different from how Expression 1 and Expression 3 are evaluated.

Here's a quick example to illustrate the difference:

```python
x = True
y = False
z = False

print(x or y and not z)       # Evaluates to True
print((x or y) and (not z))   # Evaluates to True
print(x or (y and (not z)))   # Evaluates to True

x = False
y = True
z = True

print(x or y and not z)       # Evaluates to False
print((x or y) and (not z))   # Evaluates to False
print(x or (y and (not z)))   # Evaluates to False
```

In the cases provided, Expressions 1 and 3 yield the same result, whereas Expression 2 yields a different result based on the precedence and grouping of operations.
