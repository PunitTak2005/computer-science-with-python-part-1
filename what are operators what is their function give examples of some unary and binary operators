In Python, operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They are used to manipulate data, make decisions, and control the flow of a program.

Unary Operators

Unary operators operate on a single operand. They are used to perform operations such as negation, increment, or decrement.

Examples of unary operators:

- + (positive): +5 returns 5
- - (negative): -5 returns -5
- ~ (bitwise NOT): ~5 returns -6 (inverts all bits)
- not (logical NOT): not True returns False

Binary Operators

Binary operators operate on two operands. They are used to perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Examples of binary operators:

- + (addition): 2 + 3 returns 5
- - (subtraction): 2 - 3 returns -1
- * (multiplication): 2 * 3 returns 6
- / (division): 2 / 3 returns 0.6666666666666666
- ** (exponentiation): 2 ** 3 returns 8
- == (equality): 2 == 3 returns False
- != (inequality): 2 != 3 returns True
- > (greater than): 2 > 3 returns False
- < (less than): 2 < 3 returns True

Note that some operators, such as + and -, can be used as both unary and binary operators, depending on the context.
