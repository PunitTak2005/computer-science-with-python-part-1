a,b,c=2,36
d=a+b*c/b
print(d)

The provided code snippet contains a small mistake in the assignment of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The correct assignment should include three values for `a`, `b`, and `c`. Assuming the intention is to use only two values, `a` and `b`, let's correct the code accordingly and then explain the output:

### Corrected Code

```python
a, b = 2, 36  # Assigning values to a and b
d = a + b * c / b  # There is no c defined, so let's remove it
d = a + b  # Simplified, since c is not defined
print(d)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Assignment**:
   - `a` is assigned the value `2`.
   - `b` is assigned the value `36`.

2. **Expression**:
   - The expression `a + b * c / b` is intended to be calculated.
   - Since `c` is not defined, we simplify the expression to `a + b`.

3. **Calculation**:
   - `d = 2 + 36`.

4. **Output**:
   - `print(d)` will output `38`.

### Final Code and Output

```python
a, b = 2, 36  # Assigning values to a and b
d = a + b  # Simplified calculation
print(d)  # Output: 38
```

Therefore, the output will be:

```plaintext
38
```

If the intention was to include `c` and correctly use it in the expression, please provide the value for `c` or correct the assignment.
