The id() function returns the memory address of an object. In Python, integers are immutable, which means their value cannot be changed after creation. When you do num = num + 3, a new integer object is created with the value 16, and num is assigned to reference this new object.

Here's what happens in your code:

1. num = 13: An integer object with value 13 is created, and num references it.
2. print(id(num)): Prints the memory address of the integer object 13.
3. num = num + 3: A new integer object with value 16 is created, and num references it.
4. print(id(num)): Prints the memory address of the integer object 16, which is different from the address of 13.
5. num = num - 3: A new integer object with value 13 is created, and num references it. Note that this is a new object, not the same as the original 13 object.
6. print(id(num)): Prints the memory address of the new integer object 13, which is different from the address of the original 13 object.
7. num = "Hello": A string object with value "Hello" is created, and num references it.
8. print(id(num)): Prints the memory address of the string object "Hello", which is different from the addresses of the integer objects.

So, the id() function will return different values for each print() statement because each assignment creates a new object, even if the value is the same.

Here's a sample output:

140299848970496
140299848970528
140299848970496
140299851041672

Note that the actual memory addresses will vary between runs and systems.
