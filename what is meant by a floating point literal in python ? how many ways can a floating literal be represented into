what is meant by a floating point literal in python ? how many ways can a floating literal be represented into?

In Python, a floating-point literal is a numerical value that represents a real number, with a fractional part and an exponent. It is a literal representation of a floating-point number, like 3.14 or -0.5.

A floating-point literal can be represented in several ways in Python:

1. Decimal floating-point literal: Written in decimal notation, with a fractional part and an optional exponent. Examples: 3.14, -0.5, 1.23e4, -2.34E-2
2. Exponential notation: Written in scientific notation, with a mantissa and an exponent. Examples: 1.23e4, -2.34E-2, 1.23E+4, -2.34e-2
3. Hexadecimal floating-point literal: Written in hexadecimal notation, with a fractional part and an optional exponent. Examples: 0x1.23p4, -0x1.23p-2, 0x1.23P+4, -0x1.23P-2

Note that the e or E in exponential notation represents the exponent, and the p or P in hexadecimal notation represents the exponent.

Here are some examples of floating-point literals in Python:

- 3.14 (decimal floating-point literal)
- -0.5 (decimal floating-point literal)
- 1.23e4 (exponential notation)
- -2.34E-2 (exponential notation)
- 0x1.23p4 (hexadecimal floating-point literal)
- -0x1.23p-2 (hexadecimal floating-point literal)

These representations are equivalent and can be used interchangeably in Python code.
