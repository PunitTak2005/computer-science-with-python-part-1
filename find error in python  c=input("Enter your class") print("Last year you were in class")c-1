The error in the code is:

1. print("Last year you were in class")c-1:

    - This line is trying to subtract 1 from the string c, which will raise a TypeError. You can't perform arithmetic operations on strings.
    - Also, the print statement is not closed, and the syntax is incorrect.

Corrected version:


c = input("Enter your current class: ")
last_year_class = int(c) - 1
print("Last year you were in class", last_year_class)


Or, if you want to handle cases where the user enters a non-numeric class name (like "XI", "XII", etc.):


c = input("Enter your current class: ")
if c.isdigit():
    last_year_class = int(c) - 1
    print("Last year you were in class", last_year_class)
else:
    print("Invalid class. Please enter a numeric class.")


Note: In the corrected versions, I assumed that the class is represented by a numeric value. If the class is represented by a string (like "XI", "XII", etc.), you'll need to handle the conversion differently.
