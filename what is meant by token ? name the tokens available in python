In programming, a token is a single unit of meaning in the code, such as a keyword, identifier, symbol, or literal value. Tokens are the building blocks of a programming language's syntax.

In Python, the following tokens are available:

1. Keywords: These are reserved words with special meaning, such as:
    - if
    - else
    - for
    - while
    - def
    - class
    - try
    - except
2. Identifiers: These are names given to variables, functions, and modules, such as:
    - my_variable
    - my_function
    - my_module
3. Symbols: These are special characters used in the code, such as:
    - + (addition)
    - - (subtraction)
    - * (multiplication)
    - / (division)
    - = (assignment)
    - () (parentheses)
    - [] (square brackets)
    - {} (curly braces)
4. Literals: These are values that are written directly in the code, such as:
    - 123 (integer)
    - 3.14 (float)
    - "hello" (string)
    - True (boolean)
5. Operators: These are symbols used for operations, such as:
    - + (addition)
    - - (subtraction)
    - * (multiplication)
    - / (division)
    - ** (exponentiation)
6. Delimiters: These are symbols used to separate tokens, such as:
    - , (comma)
    - . (dot)
    - : (colon)
7. Whitespace: These are spaces, tabs, and newline characters that separate tokens.

These tokens are the basic components of the Python language, and they are used to write Python code.
