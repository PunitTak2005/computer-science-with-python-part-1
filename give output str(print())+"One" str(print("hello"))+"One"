Here are the outputs:

1. str(print()) + "One"
    - print() returns None, so str(print()) becomes "None"
    - Adding "One" to that results in: "NoneOne"

2. str(print("hello")) + "One"
    - print("hello") prints "hello" to the console and returns None
    - str(print("hello")) becomes "None" again
    - Adding "One" to that results in: "NoneOne"

So, the outputs are:

NoneOne
hello
NoneOne

Note that the first and third lines are the results of the expressions, while the second line is the output of the print("hello") statement itself.
