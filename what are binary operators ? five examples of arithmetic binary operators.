**Binary operators** are operators that require two operands to perform their operation. They are used to perform a variety of operations, such as arithmetic, comparison, logical, and bitwise operations.

### Examples of Arithmetic Binary Operators

Here are five examples of arithmetic binary operators along with their explanations and examples:

1. **Addition (`+`)**
   - Adds two operands.
   - Example:
     ```python
     a = 5
     b = 3
     result = a + b  # result is 8
     ```

2. **Subtraction (`-`)**
   - Subtracts the second operand from the first.
   - Example:
     ```python
     a = 10
     b = 4
     result = a - b  # result is 6
     ```

3. **Multiplication (`*`)**
   - Multiplies two operands.
   - Example:
     ```python
     a = 7
     b = 6
     result = a * b  # result is 42
     ```

4. **Division (`/`)**
   - Divides the first operand by the second (results in a float).
   - Example:
     ```python
     a = 20
     b = 4
     result = a / b  # result is 5.0
     ```

5. **Modulus (`%`)**
   - Returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second.
   - Example:
     ```python
     a = 10
     b = 3
     result = a % b  # result is 1
     ```

### Examples in Python

Here's a Python code snippet demonstrating these arithmetic binary operators:

```python
# Addition
a = 5
b = 3
result_add = a + b
print("Addition:", result_add)  # Output: 8

# Subtraction
a = 10
b = 4
result_sub = a - b
print("Subtraction:", result_sub)  # Output: 6

# Multiplication
a = 7
b = 6
result_mul = a * b
print("Multiplication:", result_mul)  # Output: 42

# Division
a = 20
b = 4
result_div = a / b
print("Division:", result_div)  # Output: 5.0

# Modulus
a = 10
b = 3
result_mod = a % b
print("Modulus:", result_mod)  # Output: 1
```

### Summary

Binary operators operate on two operands and are used to perform various operations. The five examples of arithmetic binary operators include:

1. **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two numbers.
2. **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts one number from another.
3. **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two numbers.
4. **Division (`/`)**: Divides one number by another, resulting in a float.
5. **Modulus (`%`)**: Returns the remainder of the division of one number by another.

Understanding these operators is fundamental for performing arithmetic operations in programming.
