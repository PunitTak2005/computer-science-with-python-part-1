In Python, an expression is a piece of code that evaluates to a value. It's a combination of literals, variables, operators, and functions that can be evaluated to produce a result.

Examples of expressions in Python include:

1. Arithmetic expressions: 2 + 3, 5 * 4, 10 - 2
2. Variable expressions: x, y, z (where x, y, and z are variables)
3. Literal expressions: 5, 'hello', True
4. Function calls: abs(-5), round(3.14), len("hello")
5. Logical expressions: True and False, False or True, not True
6. Comparison expressions: 5 > 3, 4 == 4, 2 <= 3
7. String expressions: 'hello' + 'world', 'hello' * 3

Expressions can be used in various contexts, such as:

- Assigning a value to a variable: x = 5
- Printing a value: print(5)
- Using a value in a conditional statement: if x > 5: ...
- Passing a value to a function: func(5)

In general, expressions are the building blocks of Python code, and they allow you to perform calculations, manipulate data, and make decisions in your programs.
