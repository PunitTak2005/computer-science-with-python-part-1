Python was developed by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch computer programmer.
Python's development was influenced by two main languages:

1. ABC (All-purpose Business Computer): ABC was a programming language developed in the 1980s by Guido van Rossum and others at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands. ABC was designed to be easy to learn and use, and its syntax and semantics had a significant impact on the development of Python.
2. Modula-3: Modula-3 was a programming language developed in the late 1980s by Niklaus Wirth, a Swiss computer scientist. Modula-3 was designed to be a successor to Pascal, and its syntax and features influenced Python's development, particularly in terms of its syntax and module system.
