what is a statement  in python ? how is a statement different fromÂ expression?

In Python, a statement is a line of code that performs an action or sets a value. It's a complete instruction that tells the program to do something. Statements typically end with a newline character or a semicolon (;).

Examples of statements in Python include:

1. Assignment statement: x = 5 (assigns the value 5 to the variable x)
2. Print statement: print("Hello") (prints the string "Hello")
3. Conditional statement: if x > 5: print("x is greater than 5") (checks the condition and executes the code if true)
4. Loop statement: for i in range(5): print(i) (executes the code repeatedly for a specified number of iterations)
5. Function definition statement: def greet(name): print("Hello, " + name) (defines a function named greet)

A statement is different from an expression in that:

- An expression evaluates to a value, while a statement performs an action or sets a value.
- An expression can be part of a statement, but a statement is a complete instruction that stands alone.
- Statements typically don't evaluate to a value, while expressions always do.

Here's an example to illustrate the difference:

x = 5 is a statement (assignment statement) that sets the value of x to 5.

5 is an expression (literal expression) that evaluates to the value 5.

In summary:

- Expressions evaluate to values.
- Statements perform actions or set values.

While expressions are building blocks of statements, not all expressions are statements, and not all statements are expressions.
