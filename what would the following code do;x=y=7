The code x = y = 7 is an example of a chained assignment in Python.

Here's what it does:

1. Assigns the value 7 to y.
2. Assigns the value of y (which is now 7) to x.

So, after executing this code, both x and y will have the value 7.

In other words, it's equivalent to writing:

y = 7
x = y

Or:

x = 7
y = 7

This syntax is often used to initialize multiple variables to the same value in a concise way.

For example:

a = b = c = 0  # Initializes a, b, and c to 0

Note that this syntax can also be used for more complex expressions:

x = y = 2 * 3 + 1  # Assigns 7 to both x and y
