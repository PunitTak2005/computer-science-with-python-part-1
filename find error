i. i.temperature=90; print temperature

- Error: i is not defined as an object or dictionary, so you can't assign a value to i.temperature.
- Error: print temperature should be print(i.temperature) (assuming i is defined correctly).

ii. a=30; b=a+b; print(a And b)

- Error: b=a+b will raise a NameError because b is not defined before being used.
- Error: print(a And b) should be print(a and b) (lowercase and). And is not a valid keyword.
- Note: Even with corrections, a and b will perform a logical AND operation, not print both values. Use print(a, b) instead.

iii. a,b,c=2,8,9; print(a,b,c); c,b,a=a,b,c; print(a;b;c)

- Error: print(a;b;c) should be print(a, b, c) (use commas to separate values, not semicolons).

iv. x=24; 4=x

- Error: This is attempting to assign the value of x to the literal number 4, which is not allowed. You can't assign a value to a literal number.

v. print("x="x)

- Error: This should be print("x=", x) (add a comma to separate the string from the variable).

vi. else=21-5

- Error: else is a reserved keyword in Python and can't be used as a variable name.

Corrected code:

iii. a, b, c = 2, 8, 9; print(a, b, c); c, b, a = a, b, c; print(a, b, c)

iv. x = 24; x = 4 (or simply x = 4)

v. print("x=", x)

vi. result = 21 - 5 (use a different variable name instead of else)
