In Python, the real and imaginary parts of a complex number are represented as **float** data types. 

### Complex Numbers in Python

A complex number in Python is represented using the `complex` data type and is written in the form `a + bj`, where `a` is the real part and `b` is the imaginary part. Both `a` and `b` are `float` values.

**Example:**

```python
# Define a complex number
z = 3.5 + 4.2j

# Access the real part
real_part = z.real  # 3.5 (float)

# Access the imaginary part
imaginary_part = z.imag  # 4.2 (float)

print(f"Real part: {real_part} (type: {type(real_part)})")
print(f"Imaginary part: {imaginary_part} (type: {type(imaginary_part)})")
```

### Summary

- **Real Part**: Represented as a `float`.
- **Imaginary Part**: Also represented as a `float`.

In Python, complex numbers are inherently managed with floating-point precision for both parts, ensuring that calculations involving complex numbers are handled with appropriate numerical precision.
