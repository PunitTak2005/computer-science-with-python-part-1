The correct answer is: decimal

In Python, int and float are built-in numeric types, but decimal is not a built-in numeric type. However, Python provides a decimal module that allows you to work with decimal numbers.

Here are some examples:

Legal numeric types:

- x = 10 (int)
- y = 10.5 (float)

Not legal numeric type:

- z = 10.5D (decimal, not a built-in type, but can use decimal.Decimal('10.5'))

Note that you can import the decimal module and use its Decimal class to work with decimal numbers:

from decimal import Decimal
z = Decimal('10.5')
