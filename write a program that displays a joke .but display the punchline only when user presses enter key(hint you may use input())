write a program that displays a joke .but display the punchline only when user presses enter key(hint you may use input())


Here is a simple Python program that displays a joke and waits for the user to press Enter before showing the punchline:


# Display the joke
print("Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself?")

# Wait for the user to press Enter
input("Press Enter to see the punchline...")

# Display the punchline
print("Because it was two-tired!")


Here's how it works:

1. The first print statement displays the joke.
2. The input function is used to wait for the user to press Enter. The prompt "Press Enter to see the punchline..." is displayed.
3. Once the user presses Enter, the program continues to the next line.
4. The final print statement displays the punchline.

Run this program and enjoy the joke!
