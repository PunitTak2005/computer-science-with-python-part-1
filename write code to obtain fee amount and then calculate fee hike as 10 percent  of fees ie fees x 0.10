write code to obtain fee amount and then calculate fee hike as 10 percent  of fees ie fees x 0.10

# Get the current fee amount
current_fee = float(input("Enter the current fee amount: "))

# Calculate the fee hike (10% of current fee)
fee_hike = current_fee * 0.10

# Calculate the new fee amount (current fee + fee hike)
new_fee = current_fee + fee_hike

# Print the results
print(f"Current Fee: {current_fee}")
print(f"Fee Hike (10%): {fee_hike}")
print(f"New Fee: {new_fee}")


This code:

1. Asks the user to enter the current fee amount.
2. Calculates the fee hike by multiplying the current fee by 0.10 (10%).
3. Calculates the new fee amount by adding the fee hike to the current fee.
4. Prints the current fee, fee hike, and new fee amounts.

Example output:


Enter the current fee amount: 1000
Current Fee: 1000.0
Fee Hike (10%): 100.0
New Fee: 1100.0
