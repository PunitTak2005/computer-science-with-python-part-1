The numbers `33`, `33.033j`, and `33 + j` are different in Python due to their types and how they are represented:

1. **`33`**:
   - **Type**: Integer (`int`)
   - **Description**: This is a whole number with no fractional part or imaginary component.
   - **Example Usage**: Arithmetic operations with other integers or floats.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     x = 33
     print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>
     ```

2. **`33.033j`**:
   - **Type**: Complex Number (`complex`)
   - **Description**: This represents a complex number with a real part of `0` and an imaginary part of `33.033`. In Python, complex numbers are written as `a + bj`, where `a` is the real part and `b` is the imaginary part.
   - **Example Usage**: Used in complex arithmetic, such as calculations involving imaginary numbers.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     z = 33.033j
     print(type(z))  # <class 'complex'>
     print(z.real)   # 0.0
     print(z.imag)   # 33.033
     ```

3. **`33 + j`**:
   - **Type**: Syntax Error (assuming `j` is not defined elsewhere)
   - **Description**: This is intended to be a complex number, but `j` needs to be defined or initialized as a valid variable or constant. In Python, `j` is not automatically recognized as an imaginary unit unless it's used in a complex number context (e.g., `3 + 2j`).
   - **Example**: To use `33 + j` correctly, `j` should be defined as a variable or a literal complex number.
     ```python
     j = 5
     z = 33 + j  # z will be 38
     ```

### Summary

- **`33`**: An integer with no fractional or imaginary parts.
- **`33.033j`**: A complex number with no real part and an imaginary part of `33.033`.
- **`33 + j`**: This is not valid unless `j` is defined. If `j` is defined as a number, `33 + j` becomes a valid arithmetic expression. For complex numbers, the imaginary unit should be written directly in the form `a + bj`.
