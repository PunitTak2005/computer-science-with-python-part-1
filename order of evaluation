To understand the order of evaluation for these expressions, you need to consider the precedence and associativity of operators in Python. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### 1. Expression: `a > b or b <= d`

**Order of Evaluation:**
1. **Relational Operators (`>`, `<=`)**: Evaluate the relational comparisons first.
   - Compute `a > b`
   - Compute `b <= d`
2. **Logical Operator (`or`)**: Combine the results of the relational comparisons using the `or` operator.

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Compute `a > b`.
2. Compute `b <= d`.
3. Combine the results with `or`.

### 2. Expression: `x == y and y + m`

**Order of Evaluation:**
1. **Equality Operator (`==`)**: Evaluate the equality comparison first.
   - Compute `x == y`
2. **Addition (`+`)**: Evaluate the addition.
   - Compute `y + m`
3. **Logical Operator (`and`)**: Combine the results using the `and` operator. Note that for `and`, the second expression (`y + m`) will only be evaluated if the first expression (`x == y`) is true (short-circuit evaluation).

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Compute `x == y`.
2. If `x == y` is `True`, then compute `y + m`.
3. Combine the results with `and`.

### 3. Expression: `a > b < c > d`

**Order of Evaluation:**
1. **Relational Operators (`>`, `<`)**: Evaluate the relational comparisons from left to right.
   - Compute `a > b`
   - Compute the result of the previous comparison `< c`
   - Compute the result of the previous comparison `> d`

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Compute `a > b`.
2. Use the result to evaluate `< c`.
3. Use the result to evaluate `> d`.

**Example Code to Demonstrate the Evaluation:**

```python
# Define some example values
a = 10
b = 5
c = 7
d = 3
x = 8
y = 8
m = 2

# Expression 1: a > b or b <= d
result1 = (a > b) or (b <= d)
print("a > b or b <= d:", result1)  # True because a > b is True

# Expression 2: x == y and y + m
result2 = (x == y) and (y + m)
print("x == y and y + m:", result2)  # 10 because x == y is True, so y + m is evaluated

# Expression 3: a > b < c > d
result3 = a > b < c > d
print("a > b < c > d:", result3)  # True because 10 > 5 < 7 > 3 is True
```

### Summary of Order of Evaluation:

1. **`a > b or b <= d`**
   - Relational comparisons (`a > b` and `b <= d`) → Logical `or` operator

2. **`x == y and y + m`**
   - Equality comparison (`x == y`) → Addition (`y + m`) → Logical `and` operator

3. **`a > b < c > d`**
   - Relational comparisons evaluated left to right (`a > b`, then result `< c`, then result `> d`)

Understanding these rules ensures that expressions are evaluated correctly according to Python's operator precedence and associativity.
