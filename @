Here is the modified Python program that prints the output as 5@10@9:


# Assign value 5 to a variable
a = 5

# Multiply a by 2 to generate 10
b = a * 2

# Subtract 1 to generate 9
c = b - 1

# Print the output separated by '@'
print(f"{a}@{b}@{c}")  # Output: 5@10@9


Alternatively, you can also write the program in a single line using tuple unpacking:


a, b, c = 5, 5*2, 5*2-1
print(f"{a}@{b}@{c}")  # Output: 5@10@9


In both programs, the f-string formatting is used to print the values of a, b, and c separated by the @ character.
