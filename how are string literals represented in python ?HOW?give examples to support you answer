In Python, string literals are represented by enclosing a sequence of characters in:

1. Single quotes (')
2. Double quotes (")
3. Triple quotes (''' or """)

Here are some examples:

1. Single quotes:

my_string = 'Hello, World!'

1. Double quotes:

my_string = "Hello, World!"

1. Triple quotes (used for multiline strings):

my_string = """This is a
multiline string"""

or

my_string = '''This is a
multiline string'''

In Python, you can also use raw strings by prefixing the literal with r:

my_string = r'C:\Windows\System32'

This is useful when working with file paths or regular expressions.

Additionally, Python supports Unicode strings by prefixing the literal with u:

my_string = u'Hello, World!'

However, in Python 3.x, all strings are Unicode by default, so the u prefix is not necessary.

You can also use f-strings (formatted string literals) in Python 3.6+:

name = 'John'
age = 30
my_string = f'My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.'

These are just a few examples of how string literals are represented in Python.
