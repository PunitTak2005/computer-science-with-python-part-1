In Python, the concepts of "atom" and "expression" are fundamental to understanding how the language parses and evaluates code. Let's break down these terms:

### Atom

An atom is the most basic building block in Python. Atoms represent the simplest elements of a Python program that cannot be broken down further in terms of the language's syntax. These include:

1. **Identifiers (names)**: These are names given to variables, functions, classes, etc.
   ```python
   x, my_variable, function_name
   ```

2. **Literals**: These are constant values of built-in types.
   - **Integer literals**: `42`, `0`, `-7`
   - **Floating-point literals**: `3.14`, `2.0`, `-0.001`
   - **String literals**: `"hello"`, `'world'`
   - **Boolean literals**: `True`, `False`
   - **None**: The singleton value `None`

3. **Enclosures**: These include parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, and braces `{}` used for grouping expressions, creating lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
   ```python
   (1, 2), [3, 4], {5: 'five', 6: 'six'}, {7, 8}
   ```

4. **Parenthesized forms**: Expressions enclosed in parentheses are also atoms.
   ```python
   (a + b)
   ```

5. **Yield expressions**: Yield expressions used in generators.
   ```python
   yield x
   ```

6. **Await expressions**: Await expressions used in asynchronous code.
   ```python
   await coroutine_function()
   ```

### Expression

An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions that can be evaluated to produce a value. Expressions are more complex structures built using atoms and operators. They are the basic units of computation in Python and can be used wherever a value is required.

#### Types of Expressions

1. **Arithmetic expressions**: Combine numbers and operators to produce a numeric result.
   ```python
   2 + 3 * (4 - 1) / 2
   ```

2. **String expressions**: Combine strings and operators to produce a string result.
   ```python
   "hello" + " " + "world"
   ```

3. **Boolean expressions**: Combine values and logical operators to produce a Boolean result.
   ```python
   (x > 0) and (y < 10)
   ```

4. **List, dictionary, and set comprehensions**: Produce new lists, dictionaries, or sets from existing ones.
   ```python
   [x * x for x in range(10)]  # List comprehension
   {x: x * x for x in range(10)}  # Dictionary comprehension
   {x * x for x in range(10)}  # Set comprehension
   ```

5. **Function calls**: Combine function names with arguments to produce a result.
   ```python
   math.sqrt(16)
   ```

6. **Lambda expressions**: Create anonymous functions.
   ```python
   lambda x: x * 2
   ```

### Example Code

Let's look at some example code to see atoms and expressions in action:

```python
# Atoms
a = 5           # '5' is an integer literal atom
b = 3.14        # '3.14' is a floating-point literal atom
name = "Alice"  # "Alice" is a string literal atom

# Expressions
sum = a + b                # 'a + b' is an arithmetic expression
greeting = "Hello, " + name  # '"Hello, " + name' is a string expression
is_positive = (a > 0)        # 'a > 0' is a boolean expression
square_list = [x * x for x in range(5)]  # List comprehension expression

# Function call expression
import math
result = math.sqrt(16)  # 'math.sqrt(16)' is a function call expression

# Lambda expression
double = lambda x: x * 2  # 'lambda x: x * 2' is a lambda expression
```

In summary:
- **Atom**: The simplest elements in Python, such as literals, identifiers, and enclosures.
- **Expression**: Combinations of atoms and operators that can be evaluated to produce a value.
