p = 3j
q = p + (1.15j)
print(p)
print(q)

Let's break down the given code and understand what it does:

```python
p = 3j
q = p + (1.15j)
print(p)
print(q)
```

1. **`p = 3j`**:
   - `p` is assigned the value `3j`, which is a complex number with a real part of `0` and an imaginary part of `3`.

2. **`q = p + (1.15j)`**:
   - `q` is assigned the result of adding `p` and `1.15j`. 
   - Since `p` is `3j` and `1.15j` is another complex number with a real part of `0` and an imaginary part of `1.15`, adding them together yields `3j + 1.15j` which simplifies to `(3 + 1.15)j = 4.15j`.

3. **`print(p)`**:
   - This prints the value of `p`, which is `3j`.

4. **`print(q)`**:
   - This prints the value of `q`, which is `4.15j`.

### Output

```
3j
4.15j
```

Here, `3j` is the value of `p`, and `4.15j` is the result of the addition operation.
