what are augmented assignment operators?how are  they useful
Augmented assignment operators in Python are shorthand notations for performing an operation and assignment in a single step. They combine a binary operation with an assignment, making the code more concise and often more readable. Here are the most common augmented assignment operators:

1. `+=` : Addition assignment
2. `-=` : Subtraction assignment
3. `*=` : Multiplication assignment
4. `/=` : Division assignment
5. `//=`: Floor division assignment
6. `%=` : Modulus assignment
7. `**=`: Exponentiation assignment
8. `&=` : Bitwise AND assignment
9. `|=` : Bitwise OR assignment
10. `^=` : Bitwise XOR assignment
11. `<<=`: Left shift assignment
12. `>>=`: Right shift assignment

### Examples

Here are some examples of how these operators are used:

```python
x = 10

# Addition assignment
x += 5  # Equivalent to x = x + 5
print(x)  # Output: 15

# Subtraction assignment
x -= 3  # Equivalent to x = x - 3
print(x)  # Output: 12

# Multiplication assignment
x *= 2  # Equivalent to x = x * 2
print(x)  # Output: 24

# Division assignment
x /= 4  # Equivalent to x = x / 4
print(x)  # Output: 6.0

# Floor division assignment
x //= 2  # Equivalent to x = x // 2
print(x)  # Output: 3.0

# Modulus assignment
x %= 2  # Equivalent to x = x % 2
print(x)  # Output: 1.0

# Exponentiation assignment
x **= 3  # Equivalent to x = x ** 3
print(x)  # Output: 1.0

# Bitwise AND assignment
x &= 1  # Equivalent to x = x & 1
print(x)  # Output: 1

# Bitwise OR assignment
x |= 2  # Equivalent to x = x | 2
print(x)  # Output: 3

# Bitwise XOR assignment
x ^= 1  # Equivalent to x = x ^ 1
print(x)  # Output: 2

# Left shift assignment
x <<= 1  # Equivalent to x = x << 1
print(x)  # Output: 4

# Right shift assignment
x >>= 2  # Equivalent to x = x >> 2
print(x)  # Output: 1
```

### Benefits

1. **Conciseness**: They reduce the amount of code you need to write.
2. **Readability**: They make the code easier to read by clearly indicating that a variable is being modified.
3. **Efficiency**: In some cases, they can be more efficient because the variable is evaluated only once.

Augmented assignment operators are particularly useful in loops and other iterative contexts where you need to update a variable repeatedly.
