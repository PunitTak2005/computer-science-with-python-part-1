# Literal Constants
x = 5            # 5 is a literal constant
y = 3.14         # 3.14 is a literal constant
z = 'hello'      # 'hello' is a literal constant

# Identifiers
a = x            # x is an identifier (variable) referring to the value 5
b = y + 2        # y is an identifier, 2 is a literal constant

# Parenthesized Expressions
result = (x + y) * 2  # (x + y) is a parenthesized expression

# Function Calls
length = len('abc')  # len('abc') is a function call expression

# Indexing and Slicing
item = my_list[3]    # my_list[3] is an indexing expression

# Attribute Access
text = 'hello'
upper_text = text.upper()  # text.upper() is an attribute access expression
