The code you provided has some issues, specifically with using the `len()` function on boolean values, which will raise an error since booleans do not have a length. However, strings do have a length, so the code will partially work when calculating the lengths of the strings `c` and `d`.

Here's the corrected version of the code, focusing on the string lengths:

```python
a, b = bool(0), bool(0.0)
c, d = str(0), str(0.0)

# Commented out as it will raise an error
# print(len(a), len(b))

print(len(c), len(d))
```

Let's break it down:

1. `a, b = bool(0), bool(0.0)`:
   - `bool(0)` evaluates to `False`
   - `bool(0.0)` also evaluates to `False`

2. `c, d = str(0), str(0.0)`:
   - `str(0)` evaluates to `"0"`
   - `str(0.0)` evaluates to `"0.0"`

3. Attempting to print `len(a), len(b)` will raise an error because `len()` cannot be applied to boolean values.

4. Printing `len(c), len(d)`:
   - `len(c)` evaluates to `len("0")`, which is `1`
   - `len(d)` evaluates to `len("0.0")`, which is `3`

So, the output will be:

```
1 3
```

If you attempt to run the original code with the `len(a), len(b)` part, it will raise a `TypeError`. To see the valid part of the output:

```python
a, b = bool(0), bool(0.0)
c, d = str(0), str(0.0)

# The following line will raise an error
# print(len(a), len(b))

print(len(c), len(d))  # Output: 1 3
```
