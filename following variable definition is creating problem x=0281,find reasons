following variable definition is creating problem x=0281,find reasons

The variable definition x = 0281 is creating a problem because:

1. Leading zero: The number 0281 has a leading zero, which is not allowed in Python's decimal integer syntax.
2. Octal interpretation: Python interprets numbers starting with 0 as octal (base 8) numbers, not decimal (base 10) numbers.

To fix the issue, you can:

1. Remove the leading zero: x = 281
2. Use a string to represent the number: x = '0281'
3. Use a different number system (e.g., hexadecimal): x = 0x281 (this would assign the decimal value 641 to x)

If you try to run the code with the leading zero, you'll get a:

SyntaxError: leading zeros in decimal integer literals are not permitted

error message.
