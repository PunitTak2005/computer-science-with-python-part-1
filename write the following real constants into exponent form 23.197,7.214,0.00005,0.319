Here are the real constants written in exponent form:

- 23.197 = 2.3197 × 10^1
- 7.214 = 7.214 × 10^0 (or simply 7.214, since 10^0 is 1)
- 0.00005 = 5 × 10^-5
- 0.319 = 3.19 × 10^-1

Note that the exponent form is also known as scientific notation. It's a way of writing very large or very small numbers in a more compact and readable form. The format is:

a × 10^b

Where:

- a is the significand (or mantissa)
- b is the exponent
- 10 is the base (in this case, decimal)
