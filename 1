wap a program to obtain principal amount ,rate of interest and time from user and compute simple interest.

Here's a Python program that prompts the user to enter the principal amount, rate of interest, and time, and then computes the simple interest based on these inputs:

```python
# Function to calculate simple interest
def calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time):
    return (principal * rate * time) / 100

# Get input from the user
principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
rate = float(input("Enter the rate of interest (as a percentage): "))
time = float(input("Enter the time (in years): "))

# Calculate simple interest
simple_interest = calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time)

# Print the result
print(f"The simple interest is: {simple_interest}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition:**
   - `calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time)`: This function takes the principal amount, rate of interest, and time as inputs and returns the computed simple interest using the formula \(\text{Simple Interest} = \frac{\text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}}{100}\).

2. **User Input:**
   - The `input()` function is used to obtain the principal amount, rate of interest, and time from the user. These inputs are converted to `float` to allow for decimal values.

3. **Calculation:**
   - The `calculate_simple_interest` function is called with the user inputs to calculate the simple interest.

4. **Output:**
   - The result is printed using an f-string for formatting.

### Running the Program:
When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the principal amount, rate of interest, and time. After you enter these values, it will compute and display the simple interest.

Example:
```
Enter the principal amount: 1000
Enter the rate of interest (as a percentage): 5
Enter the time (in years): 3
The simple interest is: 150.0
```
