Here are the outputs:

1. print(print("Hola"))
    - print("Hola") prints "Hola" to the console and returns None
    - print(None) prints None to the console
    - Output:

Hola
None


1. print(print("Hola",end=""))
    - print("Hola",end="") prints "Hola" to the console without a newline (due to end="") and returns None
    - print(None) prints None to the console
    - Output:

HolaNone

Note that the second output has no newline between "Hola" and None because of the end="" argument in the inner print function.
