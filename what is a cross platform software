A cross-platform software is a program or application that can run on multiple operating systems (OS) or platforms, without the need for modification or recompilation. This means that a cross-platform software can be executed on different platforms, such as:

- Windows
- macOS
- Linux
- Android
- iOS
- Web browsers

Cross-platform software is designed to be platform-independent, allowing it to be developed once and deployed across various platforms, without the need for separate versions for each platform.

Some common examples of cross-platform software include:

- Web browsers (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox)
- Productivity suites (e.g., Microsoft Office, LibreOffice)
- Social media apps (e.g., Facebook, Twitter)
- Games (e.g., Minecraft, Fortnite)
- Virtualization software (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox)
- Programming languages and development tools (e.g., Python, Java, Visual Studio Code)

Cross-platform software offers several benefits, including:

- Increased reach and availability
- Reduced development and maintenance costs
- Improved user experience and consistency across platforms
- Greater flexibility and adaptability

To achieve cross-platform compatibility, developers often use various techniques, such as:

- Using platform-agnostic programming languages (e.g., Java, Python)
- Employing cross-platform frameworks and libraries (e.g., React, Angular, Qt)
- Utilizing virtualization or emulation technologies
- Implementing web-based or cloud-based solutions
