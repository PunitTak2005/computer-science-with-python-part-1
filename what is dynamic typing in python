Dynamic typing in Python means that:

1. Variable types are determined at runtime, not at compile time.
2. Variables can hold values of any type, without explicit type declaration.
3. Type checking occurs during execution, not before.

In Python, you don't need to declare the type of a variable before using it. Instead, Python infers the type based on the assigned value.

Examples:

1. x = 5 # x is an integer
2. x = "hello" # x is now a string
3. x = [1, 2, 3] # x is now a list

Dynamic typing offers flexibility, but also requires careful type management to avoid errors.

Benefits:

1. Flexibility: Variables can hold different types of values.
2. Ease of use: No need to declare types explicitly.
3. Rapid prototyping: Focus on logic without worrying about types.

Challenges:

1. Type errors: Can occur if types are not managed properly.
2. Performance: Dynamic typing can lead to slower performance.

Best practices:

1. Use clear variable names to indicate intended type.
2. Use type hints (Python 3.5+) to indicate expected types.
3. Use isinstance() to check types during execution.

By understanding dynamic typing, you can leverage Python's flexibility while maintaining code quality and avoiding type-related errors.
